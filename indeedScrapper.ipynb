Due to this being a primarily young company with the notion that everybody in the office is replaceable they get away with being able to pay below the market average for certain job roles and skill sets. This often comes as a shock to HR in exit interviews but there isnt incentive to retain good employees once they realize their market worth. I came to this company for the experience with the understanding that this wasnt going to be a longterm company to stick around with and the culture at Groupon truly cannot be beat.

I informed my manager which did nothing but cause me to become an outside among the other employees. I worked there for 5 months with very little communication and basically 0 help from any one. The supervisor never has time to actually run a machine or improve programming due to the fact of talking with other employees and visitors about none work related issues.

I have learned many skills of Finance and Accounting that I will take with me in life. Management could be a bit better but hopefully that will improve with time. The workplace culture is very closeknit and you can build many personal relationships with the people who work on the same floor as you. The hardest part of this job has to be the repetitiveness of each day and the closing of each month or quarter ends. The most enjoyable is lunch the money earned and most definitely the company surrounding you.\n",

There is no career development little to no onboarding or training information is often withheld with little to no reason and you are often micromanaged due to the lack of leadership and clear goals.  While I am very grateful for my time there I am more grateful to no longer be under the company’s thumb.

The lowerlever managers shift supervisors are comparable to the bluecollar workers below them and at times are equally lazy. The culture I think is great.

There is no worklife balance and long hours are routinely expected for no additional pay or benefits. Inconsistencies in compensation lead to disruption and animosity amongst employees.
