Due to this being a primarily young company with the notion that everybody in the office is replaceable they get away with being able to pay below the market average for certain job roles and skill sets. This often comes as a shock to HR in exit interviews but there isnt incentive to retain good employees once they realize their market worth. I came to this company for the experience with the understanding that this wasnt going to be a longterm company to stick around with and the culture at Groupon truly cannot be beat.

I informed my manager which did nothing but cause me to become an outside among the other employees. I worked there for 5 months with very little communication and basically 0 help from any one. The supervisor never has time to actually run a machine or improve programming due to the fact of talking with other employees and visitors about none work related issues.

The lowerlever managers shift supervisors are comparable to the bluecollar workers below them and at times are equally lazy. The culture I think is great.

They go out of their way not to accept return merchandise even though they say you have 30 days they will turn down a lot of returns. The atmosphere can be very cut throat if you dont do what they expect of you which is not always what I felt was ethical. I did not like the culture I dont want to work for a company that I dont respect  and  I find to be very underhanded and unethical to their customers. I was much happier when I left.\n",
